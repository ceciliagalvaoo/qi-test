## **Q3 2025: Project Kickoff and Initial Planning**

### **Objectives**

* **Establish basic platform architecture** (frontend, backend, blockchain).
* **Tokenize receivables funds** on the Stellar blockchain.
* Develop the **initial smart contract** for automated distributions.
* Implement the **interface for Investors, Consultants, and Managers**.

### **Key Milestones**

* **User onboarding** with Stellar key generation.
* **MVP launch** featuring basic tokenization and distribution functionality.

* **Tokenization and share trading** on the **Stellar DEX** to provide secondary liquidity.
* **Develop the functionality for on-chain debtor payments** using **Lumens (XLM)**.
* **Adopt global regulations** — initial adjustments for regulatory compliance (e.g., KYC, AML).

### **Key Milestones**

* **First on-chain payments** with Lumens (XLM) for debtors.
* Implement **automatic conversion from BRL → USDC** via **Reflector**, enabling international transactions.
* **Adaptation for global regulations**: initial analysis and adjustments for compliance with financial regulations (e.g., GDPR, FATF).
* Expansion of **manager and investor dashboards** with new features for **transaction monitoring** and **compliance reporting**.

## **Q1 2026: Global Compliance and International Expansion**

### **Objectives**

* **Complete integration of global regulations**, adapting the platform for compliance with specific country regulations (e.g., cryptocurrency regulation, data security, financial compliance).
* Full integration of **on-chain debtor payments** using Lumens (XLM), enabling a scalable and efficient solution for international payments.
* **Expand user base**, with a focus on international markets.

### **Key Milestones**

* **Global regulatory compliance** (e.g., alignment with the **EU Cryptocurrency Directive**, **FATF**, **KYC/AML** for international markets).
* **100% on-chain debtor payments** using **XLM**, with transparent and fast transactions between all participants.
* **Scaling to international markets**, with integration testing in **new financial markets**.
* Launch of **advanced security features** and **real-time auditing**, ensuring all transactions can be **publicly verified** without the risk of fraud.

## **Q2 2026: Continuous Improvement and Global Adoption**

### **Objectives**

* **Expand debtor payment functionality** with **Lumens (XLM)** to cover **new currencies and assets**.
* **Enhance adaptability to global regulations**, focusing on **highly regulated markets** like the **United States**, **European Union**, and **Asia**.
* **Scale the platform** to manage an increasing number of **funds and transactions**.

### **Key Milestones**

* **Full compliance with global cryptocurrency regulations**, enabling secure and transparent international transactions.
* **Continuous expansion of investor and consultant base**, focusing on **underdeveloped markets** such as **Africa** and **Latin America**.

## **Q3 2026: Globalization and Sustainable Growth**

### **Objectives**

* **Global consolidation of the platform**, ensuring full coverage for **fund managers** worldwide.
* **Integrate DeFi solutions** and **new financial technologies** that improve the scalability of the platform.
* Expand **on-chain debtor payment functionality** with **Lumens (XLM)** to enable **instant payments** between countries.

### **Key Milestones**

* **Integration with DeFi solutions**, enabling investors to access new **tokenized asset markets**, in addition to receivables funds.
* **Instant and transparent payments** with **XLM**, increasing **global liquidity** and enabling real-time trading.
* **Sustainable scalability**, with the platform able to **manage billions in transactions** with low cost and high performance.

### **Objectives**

* **End-to-end evidence for each agent/action** (who did what, when), binding off-chain documents to on-chain commitments (hash + event).

* **Tamper-evident approvals:** entity/fund approvals depend on the presence of required documents and their on-chain commitments.

* **Privacy by design:** store files off-chain (encrypted); keep only hashes + minimal metadata on-chain.


### **Key Milestones**

* **MVP:** upload → encrypt & store → compute SHA-256 → emit doc_commit event on-chain → reviewer approves/denies.

* **Policy engine:** per-action document requirements (e.g., KYC/KYB, mandate, contracts) with versioning & expiry alerts.

* **Exports & retention:** one-click evidence package (docs + JSON log) and lifecycle rules (retention/WORM buckets).

## **Conclusion**

This roadmap offers a **clear plan** for the development of **The Simple Fund**, from the **MVP launch** to its **global expansion**, with a focus on **adapting to global financial regulations** and implementing **on-chain debtor payments** via **Lumens (XLM)**.
